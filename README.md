### 👨‍💻 About Me  
I’m a Computer Science student at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)**, K24, passionate about web technologies and AI.  
Born in the digital era and exposed to technology from a young age, I knew early on I wanted to become a programmer. Through self-study and advanced standing courses, I’ve been turning that dream into reality.
