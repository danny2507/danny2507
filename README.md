### 👨‍💻 About Me  
I’m a Computer Science student at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)**, K24, passionate about web technologies and AI.  
Born in the digital era and exposed to technology from a young age, my passion for this field has been budding for a long time. Since middle school I knew I had to become a programmer. The following years were decisive: self-study and advanced standing.
